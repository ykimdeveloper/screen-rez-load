- **`navigator.userAgent`**
  - Still usable for broad classification
  - Inconsistent across OS/browsers and increasingly deprecated

- **Media Queries (`window.matchMedia`)**
  - Most reliable for layout and performance adjustments
  - Should be the primary tool for responsive design

- **Bowser (library)**
  - Recommended when we need to know the actual browser/OS  
    (e.g., Safari iOS vs Safari macOS)
  - Provides high‑level flags like `isMobile`, `isDesktop`
  - Abstracts away UA parsing

- **platform.js (library)**
  - Alternative to Bowser
  - Less actively maintained

### ✅ Recommendation
Use **media queries** for responsiveness, and **Bowser** for coarse device/browser detection when needed.  
This hybrid approach minimizes reliance on fragile UA strings while still letting us optimize for hardware constraints.


Navigator / User Agent

•  navigator.userAgent has historically been the go‑to for device/browser detection.
•  Problems:
  ⁠◦  UA strings are inconsistent across browsers and OS.
  ⁠◦  Many browsers deliberately obfuscate or “freeze” UA strings for privacy reasons.
  

Example: Chrome on iOS reports itself as “Safari” because Apple requires all iOS browsers to use WebKit.
•  Still useful?
  ⁠◦  Yes, but only for broad classification (mobile vs desktop, iOS vs Android).
  ⁠◦  Should not be relied on for fine‑grained detection (e.g., exact browser version).

Hybrid Strategy:
  ⁠◦  Use UA parsing only when you need to distinguish between OS families (e.g., Safari on iOS vs Safari on macOS).


•  Mozilla/Firefox: UA string differs slightly between Windows and macOS, but both identify as “Firefox.”
•  Safari:
◦  macOS Safari vs iOS Safari are harder to distinguish. UA string includes “Mobile” on iOS.


•  Primary: Use media queries for responsive layout and performance tuning.
•  Secondary: Use Bowser for coarse device/browser classification when you need to branch logic (e.g., disable heavy map rendering on mobile Safari).
